# General

## Tell me about yourself

I'm a Junior studying applied math and computation at University of Idaho. I was raised in a small town just outside of Moscow so I've always been from the area. After high school I had a short career as a chef before pursuing this degree. Outside of school I like to cook, read, hang out with family, and spend time outdoors. I'm quite passionate about programming and after graduation will pursue a career in software engineering. 

## What are your biggest strengths?

1. Easy to get along with. People seem to like having me in the workplace.
2. Teachable - touch on being different than willing to learn.
3. Conscientous - I take pride in my work and think there's inherent value to producing quality code.

## What is your biggest weakness?

1. By far it's my imposter syndrome. Choosing to just put mysef out there anyways. 
2. I get frustrated with solutions that I perceive to be short-sighted. Example is at Sun Valley feeling like they couldn't just cut the cord on a sunk cost.
3. I need more experience debugging complex errors or bugs. Need more time behind the keyboard with my toolchain. 

## "Tell me about ____ (project/job from resume)"

* ShiftAlert - Punch log tracking app. Business needs solved: employees could view their punches. Administrators got a better interface for certain reports. Learned a lot about developing to spec, working under timecrunch, communicating with stakeholders, dealing with changing requirements.
* Pelican contribution - Did a small refactor and contributed a feature. First instance where I could see a clear, non-contrived advantage to an object oriented approach. Gained experience in communicating remotely and asynchronously with other developers. Had to figure out how the code worked without much help.
* RPI - basically a pamphlet site in Wix. Some technical skills gained - learned basic Javascript and jQuery. Quite challenging as I'm not a front end guy. Gained experience in taking criticism, changing requirements, dealing with tons of stakeholders, and being in charge of a project that matters.
* Math tutor - communication skills. Sense of accomplishment from that lightbulb clicking. Explaining technical concepts to people who are frustrated/confused/hostile. Finding multiple ways to explain stuff.
* PK Resource - Got an insight into business services/client relations/consulting. Dipped my toes into a wide range of technical/marketing-tech services. Learned communication, independent work under a deadline, work estimates.
* Inntopia - End to end testing and QA process. Documentation of SOPs. Creating training material. Learned what it means to write good documentation. Also customer service component.

## "Tell me about a time when you..."

* Most challenging: Dealing with pay periods in shift alert app
* Most interesting: Pattern matching problem for Pelican contribution
* Hardest bug: Long load times on certain Django view in shift alert app
* Enjoyed most: Pelican contribution
* Had conflict: Training call center employees to use Inntopia, or tutoring, perhaps.

# Technical Questions

## What are some advantages to an object oriented design?

* Encapsulation - Each object manages its own state.
* Abstraction - Division of responsibilities. Allows isolated failures and ideally easier debugging.
* Inheritance - allows specialization without code reuse
* Polymorphism - if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck

# Acquisition Simplicity

## Why are you interested in working for Acquisition Simplicity?

I love the idea of working for a slightly smaller company with a start-up feel. For better or worse, whatever I do in the company is going to be more noticable/impactful so I can improve quickly. It kind of falls under that "Fail fast" mentality.
